#Category Wikipedia Page URL Scraping

A random tool to grab the URL of nonprofits, companies, or other organizations given the URL to a Wikipedia Category Page URL.  

For instance, given https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:American_veterans%27_organizations will output a CSV file with all the organizations listed on this page and their homepage URL (as long as the first link on their Wiki page is their homepage).
